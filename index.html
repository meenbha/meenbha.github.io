      <p>
        Tracy Chapman is a multi-platinum, four-time Grammy Award-winning American singer and songwriter best known for her 
        songs "Fast Car", "Give Me One Reason", "Talkin' 'bout a Revolution" 
        and "Baby Can I Hold You". 
      </p>

      <p>She was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1964. Her parents were divorced when she was four and was subsequently raised by her mother. Her mother encouraged Tracy's love for music by buying her a ukele when she was just three years old. Tracy Chapman began playing the guitar and writing songs from the age of 8. 
      </p>

      <p>While studying at high school, she was accepted into the program "A Better Chance" which gave her an opportunity to study away from home. She graduated with B.A. degree in Anthropology and African Studies from Tufts University. In 2004, she was awarded an honorary doctorate in Fine Arts by the same university for her commitment to social activism.

          <p>"Fast Car" is one of Tracy Chapman's most famous songs. The '80s folk rock ballad endures to this day. Perhaps because of its 
          beautiful storytelling. A story we can all relate to. Of big dreams, escape, responsibilities and disappointment. The song also 
          touches on poverty, the limitations of a minimum wage and alcoholism.

          <p><strong>'Don’t you know
            <br>
            They’re talking about a revolution?
            <br>
            It sounds like a whisper’ </strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            With this song, Tracy Chapman acknowledges all those who assemble to protest for social and political change.  </p>

          <p>This beautiful song oozes with love. Even those relationships where often it can be hard to say "I Love You",
            perhaps instead, as Tracy Chapman suggests, we can say "Baby Can I Hold You Tonight?".
